The course with Cristina Marinescu. She is probably the best teacher from the AC, the courses are taught very well and she answers, in a kind manner, 
to every question you have. Also, OOP is one of the most important taught subjects (if not the most important) throughout the 4 years of college. 
If you go to the course and you are active (answering questions, solving exercises the professor gives you), you can receive 1 bonus point to the lab grade 
(which can be applies only if the grade>=4.5 - you need to have a final grade to the lab >=5.00, 4.99 is not a passing grade).

Lab with Andy Molin and Mario Rivis, they are both okay. You'll have 3 tests at the lab and all of them consist of problem solving in Java. Also, you need to receive a
completion check at every lab there is not a test, prof. Marinescu will tell you more about this).

The exam consists of theoretical questions from the course, and also by checking parts of Java code. I think that if you pay attention to the courses, and go through
the slides one or two more times, you can receive quite a good grade at the exam :)
