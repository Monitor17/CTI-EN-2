The course with Razvan Cioarga. The lab with him and Bogdan Anca. I strongly recommend NOT going to Bogdan Anca's lab :(

The course won't be really useful for the exam, and the lab will consist of some 6 (or something like that) quizes from theoretical aspects from the course. 
We don't have the quizes, but some models are available on the Google Drive link I've posted at the beggining of the repository.

The exam will consist of 3 parts (you need to get a grade >=5.00, 4.99 is not a passing grade for each part):
*first part: a quiz of 10 questions, similar to the ones from the lab
*second part: a problem with data structures and probably sorting (I'm not sure)
*third part: a problem with lists or backtracking

You can expect anything from the exam, the code is automatically corrected (or was, I don't know) and if you have any compilation error, you'll get 0 on the part. 
You need to prepare everything, they won't tell you anything. You can receive two problems, similar to the ones from PT or CP from the 1st Year. So, get ready to 
study C (again) :/
